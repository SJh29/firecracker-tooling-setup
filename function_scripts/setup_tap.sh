# setup_tap.sh -- Host TAP interfaces + NAT
#
# Creates one TAP device per Firecracker instance, each on its own /30 so the
# host has an unambiguous route to every guest. Instance k gets tap<k> with host
# address 172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+1>, guest 172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+2>. See common.sh.
#
# Usage: sudo ./setup_tap.sh [-n NUM_INSTANCES]   (default: 1)
#
# Safe to re-run: each TAP is torn down and recreated, and the NAT rule is
# deleted before being re-added. run_firecracker.sh calls this automatically.
#
# Requires: ip, iptables, jq
