# Function Setup Scripts

Scripts for launching Firecracker microVMs and invoking a Lambda function inside them. Run these after the install scripts have completed.

Typical order: `build_function.sh` → `run_firecracker.sh` (separate terminal) → `invoke.sh`. Use `kill_firecracker.sh` to stop the VMs. `run_firecracker.sh` calls `setup_tap.sh` for you.

---

## Concurrency model

Every VM is identified by an integer **instance id** `k`, starting at 0. All of its host-side resources are derived from `k`, so no two instances collide:

| Resource | Instance `k` | Instance 0 | Instance 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| API socket | `/tmp/firecracker/<k>.socket` | `/tmp/firecracker/0.socket` | `/tmp/firecracker/1.socket` |
| Scratch (`/tmp`) | `instances/scratch-<k>.ext4` | `instances/scratch-0.ext4` | `instances/scratch-1.ext4` |
| Config | `instances/vm_config-<k>.json` | `instances/vm_config-0.json` | `instances/vm_config-1.json` |
| TAP device | `tap<k>` | `tap0` | `tap1` |
| Host IP | `172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+1>` | `172.16.0.1` | `172.16.0.5` |
| Guest IP | `172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+2>` | `172.16.0.2` | `172.16.0.6` |
| Guest MAC | `06:00:AC:10:<k/64>:<4(k%64)+2>` (hex) | `...:00:02` | `...:00:06` |
| cgroup | `/sys/fs/cgroup/firecracker/vm<k>` | `.../vm0` | `.../vm1` |
| CPU set | `vcpu_count` whole physical cores | e.g. `0,2` | e.g. `4,6` |

**Drive layout -- what's shared vs. per-instance:**

| Drive | Guest mount | Sharing | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| rootfs (`aws_baseimage.ext4`) | `/` | **one shared copy, read-only** | Read-only makes sharing safe and forces all writable state onto `/tmp`, exactly as real Lambda does |
| function (`function.ext4`) | `/var/task` | **one shared copy, read-only** | Function code; Lambda's task root is read-only too |
| scratch (`scratch-<k>.ext4`) | `/tmp` | **per-instance, writable** | The guest's only writable path. Fresh `mkfs` each launch, `nodatacow` on btrfs to keep the write-heavy path off CoW |

Each VM also gets its **own point-to-point /30**, so the host routing table stays unambiguous. Nothing writable is shared, so concurrent VMs can't corrupt each other's disk.

Instance 0 resolves to exactly the old single-VM values, so the previous setup is just the `k=0` case of this one. The /30s tile the whole of `172.16.0.0/16` -- the third octet supplies 256 blocks of 64 subnets each -- so the addressing caps the design at **16384 instances** (`k` = 0..16383, last usable /30 `172.16.255.252`). That is `MAX_INSTANCES` in [common.sh](../common.sh) and it is the only *hard* ceiling; in practice host RAM binds long first (see [the memory ceiling](#the-memory-ceiling) below).

The addressing helpers (`fc_socket`, `fc_scratch`, `fc_tap`, `fc_host_ip`, `fc_guest_ip`, `fc_mac`, `fc_instances`) all live in [common.sh](../common.sh) -- no script hardcodes these paths. The CPU topology helpers (`fc_cpu_list`, `fc_cpu_pool`, `fc_cpu_nodes`, `fc_cpu_count`, `fc_reserved_cpus`, `fc_free_cpus`) live there too.

> A separate benchmark, [temp_reflink_setup.sh](../temp_reflink_setup.sh), instead gives each VM a `cp --reflink=auto` **writable** clone of the whole rootfs (`instances/rootfs-<k>.ext4`) and times create→first-invocation. It's the alternative this shared-rootfs + scratch layout was chosen over; keep it only for the comparison.

---

## [run_firecracker.sh](../run_firecracker.sh)

Starts one or more Firecracker microVMs, each bound to its own API socket and config.

**Requires:** `./firecracker` binary, `./vm_config.template.json`, `aws_baseimage.ext4`, `function.ext4`, `jq`.

Run this in a dedicated terminal -- it blocks until the VMs are stopped, and cleans up sockets, scratch drives and TAP devices on exit (including Ctrl-C). The shared read-only rootfs is never touched.

```
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh                    # 1 VM
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh -n 4               # 4 concurrent VMs
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh -n 4 -m 1024       # 4 VMs, 1024 MiB each
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh -n 4 -S 256        # 4 VMs, 256 MiB /tmp each
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-n NUM_INSTANCES` | Number of concurrent microVMs. Refused if the fleet won't fit in host RAM, or past `MAX_INSTANCES` (16384) | `1` |
| `-m MEM_MIB` | Guest memory per VM; also rewrites `func_mem_size` in the boot args | from template (`3538`) |
| `-S SCRATCH_MB` | Size of each VM's writable `/tmp` scratch drive | `128` |
| `-u` | Run unmetered (`cpu.max=max`) instead of enforcing the Lambda quota | off |

| Env | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CPU_POOL` | The set of host CPUs the whole fleet shares, as either a cpuset list (`0-23,48-71`) or a count of CPUs | the whole host |
| `OVERSUB` | Requested vCPUs per pool CPU; sizes the pool to `ceil(N × vcpu_count / OVERSUB)`. Ignored when `CPU_POOL` is set | -- |
| `CPU_MAX` | Raw `cpu.max` quota; overrides both the default and `-u` | -- |
| `FC_HOST_RESERVE_MIB` | RAM held back for the host itself when sizing the `-n` ceiling | `2048` |
| `FC_VMM_OVERHEAD_MIB` | Firecracker's own footprint per VM, on top of guest RAM | `8` |

**What it does, per instance:**
1. Creates a fresh `${SCRATCH_MB}` MiB ext4 scratch image → `instances/scratch-<k>.ext4` (`mkfs.ext4` each launch, so `/tmp` starts empty and identical every run). The rootfs is **not** copied -- all instances share `aws_baseimage.ext4` read-only.
2. Renders `vm_config.template.json` → `instances/vm_config-<k>.json`, substituting the scratch path, TAP device, MAC, and the `guest_ip=`/`gateway=` kernel boot args.
3. Creates the leaf cgroup `/sys/fs/cgroup/firecracker/vm<k>` and enrolls that VM in it, so the CPU quota is per-instance rather than shared.
4. Launches Firecracker on `/tmp/firecracker/<k>.socket`, with its console redirected to `logs/<timestamp>/console-<k>.log`.

### The memory ceiling

`-n` is checked against host RAM before the run starts, and refused if the fleet won't fit:

```
capacity = (MemTotal - FC_HOST_RESERVE_MIB) / (mem_size_mib + FC_VMM_OVERHEAD_MIB)
```

The check is a hard error rather than a warning because memory, unlike CPU, does not degrade gracefully: an overcommitted fleet is not a slow run but an OOM kill partway through one, which corrupts the measurement instead of merely slowing it. CPU overcommit stays a warning for exactly that reason -- contention is a legitimate thing to measure.

`MemTotal` is used rather than `MemAvailable` so the ceiling is a property of the host, identical on every run, instead of a function of how full the page cache happens to be at launch. The two knobs are the reserve the host keeps for itself (page cache, the collectors, the load generator) and Firecracker's per-VM footprint on top of guest RAM; lower them to pack the host tighter, raise them to be more conservative:

```bash
# 192 GiB host, 3538 MiB guests -> capacity 54
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh -n 60                              # refused
sudo FC_HOST_RESERVE_MIB=1024 ./run_firecracker.sh -n 60     # capacity 55 -> still refused
sudo ./run_firecracker.sh -n 60 -m 1024                      # smaller guests, fits
```

At launch the script reports where the fleet sits against the ceiling:

```
Memory: 3538 MiB x 32 of 196608 MiB host (capacity 54 instances)
```

Note that the ceiling tracks `-m`, so a memory sweep silently changes how many VMs a given host will accept -- at the template's 3538 MiB a 192 GiB host takes 54, at 128 MiB it takes 1430.

### CPU quota and the shared pool

`cpu.max` is set to `mem_size_mib / 1769` vCPUs per instance -- AWS Lambda's CPU-per-memory ratio -- so a guest gets the same share of a core that the equivalent Lambda would. This is the mechanism that matches Lambda, which meters CPU time by memory size and leaves placement to the host scheduler. `-u` removes the cap; use it only when the run is not being compared against Lambda.

The quota governs *how much* CPU a VM gets, not *which* CPUs it runs on. `CPU_POOL` designates the set of host CPUs available to the **fleet as a whole** -- every instance shares it, none owns a slice of it. The cpuset is written once to the parent cgroup `/sys/fs/cgroup/firecracker` and inherited by each `vm<k>` leaf, so instances contend for the pool the way co-tenant functions contend for a host. With no pool set, the fleet may run anywhere on the host.

Give the pool either as a literal cpuset list or as a count of CPUs:

```bash
sudo CPU_POOL=0-23 ./run_firecracker.sh -n 8      # the fleet shares CPUs 0-23
sudo CPU_POOL=16   ./run_firecracker.sh -n 8      # the fleet shares 16 CPUs
```

A bare integer is read as a count, so a single-CPU pool has to be written as a range (`3-3`). A pool given by count is taken in NUMA order, filling whole cores and whole nodes before spilling onto the next, and `cpuset.mems` is bound to the nodes it lands on so cross-node memory access does not add variance belonging to the host rather than to the workload.

`OVERSUB` sizes the pool relative to what the fleet requests, as `ceil(N × vcpu_count / OVERSUB)`. This is what turns co-tenancy into a controlled variable: `OVERSUB=1` gives the fleet exactly as many CPUs as it asks for, `OVERSUB=2` gives it half, and `OVERSUB=0.5` gives it twice as many.

```bash
sudo OVERSUB=2 ./run_firecracker.sh -n 8          # 8 VMs contend 2:1 for the pool
```

At launch the script reports the pool, the fleet's aggregate quota, and the resulting ratio, and warns when the fleet requests more CPU than the pool holds:

```
CPU pool: 0-15  (16 cpus, node(s) 0)
Requested CPU: 16.00 vcpu over 16 cpus (1.00x)
```

Both the quota and the pool need the `cpu` and `cpuset` controllers delegated -- run [install_cgroup.sh](../install_cgroup.sh) once to check. A missing `cpuset` controller downgrades to a warning and the VMs still start, unpooled.

It also invokes `setup_tap.sh -n N` first and marks the scratch directory `nodatacow` on btrfs.

### Console logs

Each launch creates `logs/<YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>/`, with one `console-<k>.log` per instance, plus a `logs/latest` symlink to the current run. Unlike `instances/`, these are **not** deleted on shutdown, and they are chowned back to `$SUDO_USER` so they can be read without sudo.

```
tail -f logs/latest/console-0.log
```

Each file holds that VM's guest kernel messages, the bootstrap wrapper's output (drive mounts, guest IP, handler), the Lambda RIE's per-invocation `START` / `END` / `REPORT` lines -- `REPORT` carries `Duration` and `Max Memory Used`, which pair naturally with the power traces -- and Firecracker's own log lines. **Nothing from the VMs appears on the launcher's terminal any more**, so check the log if an instance dies at startup.

> **Why files rather than the terminal.** Firecracker sets its own stdout to `O_NONBLOCK` at startup, because the 8250 serial device is written from the vCPU thread and a blocking write to a slow console would stall the guest. When the fd's buffer fills, `write()` returns `EAGAIN` and the bytes are silently dropped, logged as `Failed the write to serial: IOError(Os { code: 11, kind: WouldBlock, ... })`. A terminal or a pipe (`fc_experiment.sh` tees the launcher through one, 64 KiB buffer) fills easily -- all N VMs inherited a *single* stdout, and boot and invocation bursts are exactly when the consumer falls behind. Writes to a regular file ignore `O_NONBLOCK` and never return `EAGAIN`, so per-instance log files remove the failure mode instead of hiding it, while also de-interleaving concurrent guests and keeping terminal rendering out of the host power measurement.

> If a payload can write more than `-S` MiB to `/tmp` in one invocation, the guest hits `ENOSPC` mid-run -- raise `-S`. The chacha20 default writes ~16 MiB, well under 128.

> **The CPU quota is enforced by default**, at the memory-proportional rate of 1 vCPU per 1769 MB. `-u` writes `cpu.max` as `max <period>` to lift it, and `CPU_MAX` overrides both.

## [function_scripts/setup_tap.sh](../function_scripts/setup_tap.sh)

Creates one host TAP device per instance and configures NAT so the guests can reach the internet.

**Requires:** `iproute2` (`ip`), `iptables`, `jq`.

```
sudo ./function_scripts/setup_tap.sh -n 4
```

**What it does:**
1. For each `k` in `0..N-1`: deletes any stale `tap<k>`, then recreates it at `172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+1>/30`.
2. Enables IPv4 forwarding (`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`).
3. Sets `iptables FORWARD` policy to `ACCEPT`.
4. Adds a single `MASQUERADE` NAT rule on the host's default interface -- one rule covers every TAP.

`run_firecracker.sh` calls this automatically. Re-running is safe: stale devices and rules are removed first.

---

## [function_scripts/build_function.sh](../function_scripts/build_function.sh)

Packages everything in the `function/` folder into a small ext4 drive that the guests mount at `/var/task`.

**Requires:** `e2fsprogs` (`mkfs.ext4`), a non-empty `function/` directory.

**Produces:** `function.ext4` (32 MB ext4 image).

One image serves **every** concurrent microVM -- the guests mount it read-only, so sharing it is safe and matches Lambda's read-only task root.

Re-run this whenever the function changes. The previous `function.ext4` is always replaced.

---

## [function_scripts/invoke.sh](../function_scripts/invoke.sh)

Sends a JSON payload to the Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE) inside a guest and prints the response.

**Requires:** A running VM reachable at `172.16.<k/64>.<4(k%64)+2>:8080`, `curl`, `jq`.

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-i INSTANCE` | Instance id to invoke | `0` |
| `-a` | Invoke **every** running instance concurrently and wait for all of them | off |
| `-p PAYLOAD` | JSON body sent to the invocation endpoint | `{"method": "graph-mst", "size": "1000000"}` |
| `-t TIMEOUT` | Maximum wait time in seconds | `300` |

**What the default payload runs.** [`function/handler.py`](../function/handler.py) dispatches on the payload's `method` field against the benchmarks in [`function/benchmark/`](../function/benchmark/); a missing or unrecognized `method` returns an error instead of running anything. The default payload's `method: "graph-mst"` runs SeBS 502.graph-mst -- builds a Barabási–Albert graph of `size` vertices and computes its spanning tree. `size: 1000000` is a large graph; expect the default smoke-test invocation to take noticeably longer than the chacha20 path. To run the chacha20 benchmark instead:
```bash
./function_scripts/invoke.sh -p '{"method": "chacha20", "rounds": 100000, "password": "benchmarkpass", "seed": 42}'
```

```
./function_scripts/invoke.sh              # instance 0
./function_scripts/invoke.sh -i 2         # instance 2
./function_scripts/invoke.sh -a           # all running instances, in parallel
```

With `-a` the instances are fired simultaneously (not one after another), so they contend for the host the way a real concurrent workload would. Responses are buffered and printed in instance order so parallel output doesn't interleave. Exits non-zero if any response contains an `errorMessage` field or if `curl` times out.

---

## [function_scripts/gen_saaf_functions.sh](../function_scripts/gen_saaf_functions.sh)

Writes one SAAF function JSON per running instance, each pointing at that VM's RIE endpoint.

**Requires:** Running VMs, `jq`.

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-o OUTDIR` | Directory to write into | `saaf/functions` |
| `-N NAME` | Base function name (files get a `-vm<k>` suffix) | `firecracker` |

---

## [function_scripts/run_saaf_experiment.sh](../function_scripts/run_saaf_experiment.sh)

Drives every running microVM concurrently with [saaf_driver.py](../function_scripts/saaf_driver.py) and writes SAAF reports.

**Requires:** Running VMs, the `SAAF` submodule (`git submodule update --init`), `python3` with `requests`, `jq`.

```
./function_scripts/run_saaf_experiment.sh
./function_scripts/run_saaf_experiment.sh -e saaf-experiment/my-experiment.json -o saaf/results/run1
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-e EXPERIMENT` | SAAF experiment JSON | `saaf-experiment/experiment-fidelity.json` |
| `-o OUTDIR` | Results directory | `saaf/results/<timestamp>` |
| `-N NAME` | Report file prefix | `firecracker` |

`saaf-experiment/` holds checked-in experiment definitions (tracked in git); `saaf/functions/` and `saaf/results/` hold this script's generated output (git-ignored).

| Env | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SAAF_DIR` | Path to the SAAF checkout | `SAAF` |

The script itself only discovers instances, generates their function JSONs, and `taskset`s the driver onto CPUs no microVM is using -- the complement of the CPU pool plus its hyperthread siblings -- so the load generator never competes with a guest for a core. The siblings are excluded because a task on one shares execution units with the pool CPU it partners. Keeping the driver off the pool is measurement hygiene rather than an attempt to emulate Lambda: the load generator is not part of the platform under study, and if it lands on a guest's CPU it perturbs the very durations being recorded. It warns when no pool is set, and if any instance has `cpu.max=max` (an unmetered guest isn't held to the Lambda CPU allocation, so its durations aren't comparable).

---

## [function_scripts/saaf_driver.py](../function_scripts/saaf_driver.py)

Replaces SAAF's `faas_runner.py`. Report generation is **not** reimplemented -- `report()` and `write_file()` are imported from the submodule, so the CSVs are the same ones SAAF would produce.

```
python3 function_scripts/saaf_driver.py -f FUNC.json [FUNC.json ...] \
    -e EXPERIMENT.json -o OUTDIR --saaf SAAF [--name PREFIX]
```

**Why not `faas_runner.py`.** It can only ever call `functions[0]`: `experiment_orchestrator.py` passes `callExperiment([func], exp)`, so the per-function fan-out inside `callExperiment` is unreachable and N endpoints cannot be driven from one invocation. Working around that meant one process per VM, flattening raw run directories to re-feed `compile_results.py`, and a no-op `xdg-open` on `PATH` because `compile_results.py` hardcodes `write_file(..., True)` and blocks forever on a headless host. Calling `report()` directly removes all three.

It also drops two upstream landmines: the payload list is sized to `runs` while the thread loop consumes `runs x endpoints` (`IndexError`, swallowed by a bare `except`, leaving threads unstarted), and responses are parsed with `ast.literal_eval`, which rejects JSON `null`/`true`/`false`. The driver sizes payloads correctly and uses `json.loads`.

**Semantics.** `runs` is the total across all endpoints and `threads` is the concurrency, exactly as in SAAF -- so one experiment file describes the same workload on Lambda and here. Each endpoint gets `runs / endpoints` sequential calls with one request in flight, because the RIE serves a single invocation at a time; concurrency comes from the VM count. If `threads` doesn't equal the number of endpoints, the driver says so and uses the endpoint count.

Per-run fields (`1_run_id`, `2_thread_id`, `zAll`, `roundTripTime`, `latency`, the `cpuType`/`cpuModel` concat, and the comma/tab/newline stripping that `report()`'s unquoted CSV writer needs) are ported from `callPostProcessor` unchanged, with one intentional difference: **`endpoint` is always recorded.** SAAF drops it whenever the response carries a `platform` field, which the Inspector always sets -- which is why it was missing from reports before.

**Reading the results.** Output layout:

```
saaf/results/<timestamp>/
  functions/vm<k>.json                  generated endpoints
  <name>-<experiment>-run<i>.csv        one report per iteration
  <name>-<experiment>-run<i>/           that iteration's raw run JSONs
  <name>-<experiment>-COMBINED.csv      iterations past warmupBuffer, merged
  driver.log
```

Group by **`endpoint`** or **`uuid`** -- not `vmID` or `containerID`. `containerID` is the RIE's fixed log-stream name and is identical in every VM; `vmID` is read from a cgroup v1 path the guest doesn't have and comes back empty. `uuid` comes from `/tmp/container-id` on the per-instance scratch drive, so it is unique per VM per launch. For the same reason `newcontainer=1` marks each VM's first call: the scratch drive is re-`mkfs`'d every launch, so a cold start needs a VM relaunch, not just another iteration.

---

## [kill_firecracker.sh](../kill_firecracker.sh)

Cleanly stops **all** running Firecracker microVMs.

Discovers the running instances from the sockets on disk (rather than being told how many there are), sends each a `SendCtrlAltDel`, then force-kills any VMM still alive 3 seconds later -- a guest that ignores Ctrl-Alt-Del would otherwise keep its scratch drive and TAP pinned and poison the next launch. Finally it removes the sockets, the TAP devices, and the per-instance scratch drives and configs. The shared read-only rootfs and function drive are left untouched.

If no sockets are found, falls back to `pkill` on the Firecracker process.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-k` | Keep the per-instance scratch drives and configs (for post-mortem) |

```
sudo ./kill_firecracker.sh
```
